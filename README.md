🚀 InTouch - Social Network Platform

InTouch is a modern social network designed to connect people through posts, stories, and private messages. This project was developed as part of a Fullstack web application using Angular and ASP.NET Core.

The system allows users to create personal profiles, upload posts, photos, and videos, comment, like, follow other users, and share stories. In addition, there is a messaging area (chats) that enables direct communication between users.

A strong emphasis was placed on providing a smooth and enjoyable user experience, with a clean design, soft animations, and intuitive navigation flow between screens.
